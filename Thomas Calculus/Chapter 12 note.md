### 12.2 Vectors
#### Component Form
>**DEFINITIONS**   
The vector represented by the directed line segment $\overrightarrow{AB}$ has initial point $A$ and terminal point B and its length is denoted by $|\overrightarrow{AB}|$ . Two vectors are equal if they have the same length and direction

>**DEFINITION**   
If $\mathbf{v}$ is a two-dimensional vector in the plane equal to the vector with initial point at the origin and terminal point $(v_1 , v_2)$, then the component form of $\mathbf{v}$ is
>$$
>\mathbf{v} = <v_1,v_2>
>$$
>If $\mathbf{v}$ is a three-dimensional vector equal to the vector with initial point at the origin and terminal point $(v_1 ,v_2,v_3)$, then the component form of $\mathbf{v}$ is
>$$
>\mathbf{v} = <v_1,v_2,v_3>
>$$
#### Vector Algebra Operations
>**DEFINITIONS**   
Let $\mathbf{u} = (u_1 ,u_2,u_3)$ and $\mathbf{v} = (v_1 ,v_2,v_3)$ be vectors with $k$ a scalar.   
>Addition: 
>$$
>\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = <u_1 + v_1,u_2 +v_2,u_2>
>$$
>scalar multiplication: 
>$$
>k\mathbf{u}= <ku_1,ku_2,ku_3>
>$$
