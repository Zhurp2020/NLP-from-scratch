#### Matching Surfaces with Level Curves
Exercises 31–36 show level curves for six functions. The graphs of these functions are given on the next page (items a–f ), as are their equations (items g–l). Match each set of level curves with the appropriate graph and appropriate equation

#### Functions of Two Variables  
Display the values of the functions in Exercises 37–48 in two ways: (a) by sketching the surface $z=f(x,y)$ and (b) by drawing an assortment of level curves in the function’s domain. Label each level curve with its function value.

37. $f(x,y)=y^2$   
#### Finding Level Curves
In Exercises 49–52, find an equation for and sketch the graph of the level curve of the function $f(x,y)$ that passes through the given point.

49. $f(x,y) = 16 - x^2 - y^2,(2\sqrt{2},\sqrt{2})$  
    $16 -x^2 - y^2 = 6$
#### Sketching Level Surfaces
In Exercises 53–60, sketch a typical level surface for the function.

53. $f(x,y,z)=x^2+y^2+z^2$
#### Finding Level Surfaces
In Exercises 61–64, find an equation for the level surface of the function through the given point.

61. $f(x, y, z) = \sqrt{x - y} - \ln z, (3, -1, 1)$  
    $\sqrt{x - y} - \ln z = 2$
