### 12.2 Vectors
#### Vectors in the Plane

17. $\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}$ if $P_1$ is the point $(5, 7, -1)$ and $P_2$ is the point $(2, 9, -2)$  
    $\overrightarrow{P_1P_2} = (-3,2,-1) = -3\mathbf{i} +2\mathbf{j} -\mathbf{k}$
#### Geometric Representations
In Exercises 23 and 24, copy vectors $\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v},$ and $\mathbf{w}$ head to tail as needed to sketch the indicated vector.  

23. a. $\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}$

    $\dfrac{\overrightarrow{P_1P_2}}{5\sqrt{2}},(\dfrac{3}{2},2,-\dfrac{5}{2})$  
#### Theory and Applications
41. Linear combination Let $\mathbf{u} = 2\mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}, v = \mathbf{i} + \mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{j}$. Find scalars $a$ and $b$ such that $\mathbf{u} = a\mathbf{v} + b\mathbf{w}$  
    $a = 2,b=-3$
