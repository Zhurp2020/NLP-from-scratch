### 14.1 Functions of Several Variables
>**DEFINITIONS**   
Suppose $D$ is a set of $n$-tuples of real numbers  $(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n).$ A real-valued function $f$ on $D$ is a rule that assigns a unique (single) real number

>to each element in $D$. The set $D$is the function’s domain. The set of $w$-values
taken on by $f$ is the function’s range. The symbol $w$ is the dependent variable of $f$, and $f$ is said to be a function of the $n$ independent variables $x_1$ to $x_n$. We also call the $x_j$’s the function’s input variables and call $w$ the function’s output variable.
#### Domains and Ranges
#### Functions of Two Variables
>**DEFINITIONS**   
A point $(x_0, y_0)$ in a region (set) $R$ in the $xy$-plane is an interior point of $R$ if it is the center of a disk of positive radius that lies entirely in $R$. $(x_0, y_0)$ is a boundary point of $R$ if every disk centered at $(x_0, y_0)$ contains points that lie outside of $R$ as well as points that lie in $R$. (The boundary point itself need not belong to $R$.) The interior points of a region, as a set, make up the interior of the region. The region’s boundary points make up its boundary. A region is open if it consists entirely of interior points. A region is closed if it contains all its boundary points.

>**DEFINITIONS**  
A region in the plane is bounded if it lies inside a disk of finite radius. A region is unbounded if it is not bounded.
#### Graphs, Level Curves, and Contours of Functions of Two Variables
>**DEFINITIONS**   
The set of points in the plane where a function $f(x, y)$ has a constant value $f(x, y) = c$ is called a level curve of $f$. The set of all points $(x, y, f(x, y))$ in space, for $(x, y)$ in the domain of $ƒ$, is called the graph of $f$. The graph of $f$ is also called the surface $z = f(x, y)$.
#### Functions of Three Variables
>**DEFINITION**   
The set of points $(x, y, z)$ in space where a function of three independent variables has a constant value $f(x, y, z) = c$ is called a level surface of $f$

>**DEFINITIONS**  
A point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ in a region $R$ in space is an interior point of $R$ if it is the center of a solid ball that lies entirely in $R$ . A point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a boundary point of $R$ if every solid ball centered at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ contains points that lie outside of $R$ as well as points that lie inside $R$. The interior of $R$ is the set of interior points of $R$. The boundary of $R$ is the set of boundary points of $R$.  
A region is open if it consists entirely of interior points. A region is closed if it contains its entire boundary
