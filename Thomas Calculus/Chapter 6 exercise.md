#### Choosing the Washer Method or Shell Method
For some regions, both the washer and shell methods work well for the solid generated by revolving the region about the coordinate axes, but this is not always the case. When a region is revolved about the $y$-axis, for example, and washers are used, we must integrate with respect to $y$. It may not be possible, however, to express the integrand in terms of $y$. In such a case, the shell method allows us to integrate with respect to $x$ instead. Exercises 29 and 30 provide some insight.

29.  Compute the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y = x$ and $y = x^2$ about each coordinate axis using  
a. the shell method. b. the washer method.

   $= \int_0^12\pi y^{\frac{3}{2}}-2\pi y^2 dy$  
   $= [\dfrac{4}{5}\pi y^{\frac{5}{2}}-\dfrac{2}{3}\pi y^3]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{2}{15}\pi$   
   $V_y = \int_0^12\pi\cdot(x-x^2)\cdot x dx$  
   $= \int_0^12\pi x^2-2\pi x^3dx$  
   $= [\dfrac{2}{3}\pi x^3-\dfrac{1}{2}\pi x^4]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{1}{6}\pi$  
   b. $V_x = \int_0^1\pi\cdot(x^2-x^4)dx$   
   $= [\dfrac{1}{3}\pi x^3-\dfrac{1}{5}\pi x^5]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{2}{15}\pi$  
   $V_y = \int_0^1\pi\cdot(y-y^2) dy$   
   $= [\dfrac{1}{2}\pi y^2-\dfrac{1}{3}\pi y^3]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{1}{6}\pi$

a. Plot the curve together with the polygonal path approximations for $n = 2, 4, 8$ partition points over the interval. (See Figure 6.22.)    
b. Find the corresponding approximation to the length of the curve by summing the lengths of the line segments.  
c. Evaluate the length of the curve using an integral. Compare your approximations for $n = 2, 4, 8$ with the actual length given by the integral. How does the actual length compare with the approximations as $n$ increases? Explain your answer.
