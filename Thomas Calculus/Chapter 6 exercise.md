#### Choosing the Washer Method or Shell Method
For some regions, both the washer and shell methods work well for the solid generated by revolving the region about the coordinate axes, but this is not always the case. When a region is revolved about the $y$-axis, for example, and washers are used, we must integrate with respect to $y$. It may not be possible, however, to express the integrand in terms of $y$. In such a case, the shell method allows us to integrate with respect to $x$ instead. Exercises 29 and 30 provide some insight.

29.  Compute the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y = x$ and $y = x^2$ about each coordinate axis using

   $= \int_0^12\pi y^{\frac{3}{2}}-2\pi y^2 dy$  
   $= [\dfrac{4}{5}\pi y^{\frac{5}{2}}-\dfrac{2}{3}\pi y^3]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{2}{15}\pi$   
   $V_y = \int_0^12\pi\cdot(x-x^2)\cdot x dx$  
   $= \int_0^12\pi x^2-2\pi x^3dx$  
   $= [\dfrac{2}{3}\pi x^3-\dfrac{1}{2}\pi x^4]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{1}{6}\pi$  
   b. $V_x = \int_0^1\pi\cdot(x^2-x^4)dx$   
   $= [\dfrac{1}{3}\pi x^3-\dfrac{1}{5}\pi x^5]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{2}{15}\pi$  
   $V_y = \int_0^1\pi\cdot(y-y^2) dy$   
   $= [\dfrac{1}{2}\pi y^2-\dfrac{1}{3}\pi y^3]_0^1$  
   $= \dfrac{1}{6}\pi$

   $\Delta W = 7488\Delta y (-y)$  
   $W = \int_{-20}^0-7488ydy$  
   $= \int_0^{20}7488ydy$  
   $= 3744y^2]_0^{20}$

   $= 1502160$ft-lb 
#### Work and Kinetic Energy
25. Kinetic energy. If a variable force of magnitude $F(x)$ moves an object of mass $m$ along the $x$-axis from $x_1$ to $x_2$, the object’s velocity $v$ can be written as $\dfrac{dx}{dt}$ (where $t$ represents time). Use Newton’s second law of motion $F = m(\dfrac{dv}{dt})$ and the Chain Rule
    $$
    \dfrac{dv}{dt} = \dfrac{dv}{dx}\dfrac{dx}{dt} = v\dfrac{dv}{dx}
    $$
    to show that the net work done by the force in moving the object from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is
    $$
    W = \int^{x_2}_{x_1}F(x) dx = \dfrac{1}{2}mv_2^2- \dfrac{1}{2}mv_1^2
    $$
    where $v_1$ and $v_2$ are the object’s velocities at $x_1$ and $x_2$. In physics, the expression $\dfrac{1}{2}mv2$ is called the kinetic energy of an object of mass $m$ moving with velocity $v$. Therefore, the work done by the force equals the change in the object’s kinetic energy, and we can find the work by calculating this change.

Show that the centroid lies at the intersection of the medians by showing that it too lies one-third of the way from each side toward the opposite vertex. To do so, take the following steps.
