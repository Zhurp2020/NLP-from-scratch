### 6.1 Volumes Using Cross-Sections
#### Slicing by Parallel Planes
>**DEFINITION**   
The volume of a solid of integrable cross-sectional area $A(x)$ from $x = a$ to $x = b$ is the integral of $A$ from $a$ to $b$,
>$$
>V = \int_a^bA(x)dx
>$$
#### Solids of Revolution: The Disk Method
>Volume by Disks for Rotation About the $x$-Axis  
>$$
>V = \int_a^bA(x)dx = \int_a^b\pi [R(x)^2]dx
>$$
#### Solids of Revolution: The Washer Method
### 6.2 Volumes Using Cylindrical Shells
#### Slicing with Cylinders
#### The Shell Method
### 6.3 Arc Length
.**DEFINITION**   
If $f'$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ , then the length (arc length) of the curve $y = fÆ’(x)$ from the point $A = (a, f(a))$ to the point $B = (b, f(b))$ is the value of the integral
>$$
>L = \int_a^b\sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}dx
>$$
