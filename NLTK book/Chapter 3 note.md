Given a hypothetical segmentation of the source text, derive a lexicon and a derivation table that permit the source text to be reconstructed, then total up the number of characters used by each lexical item (including a boundary marker) and the number of lexical items used by each derivation, to serve as a score of the quality of the segmentation; smaller values of the score indicate a better segmentation.
