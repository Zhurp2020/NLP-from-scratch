## Lecture 18 Future of NLP and Deep learning
### Large language models and GPT-3
### Compositional representations and systematic generalization 
+ Systematicity: the ability to understand/produce some sentences is intrinsically connected to the ability to produce/understand certain others. 
+ Compositionality: The meaning of an expression is a function of the meaning of its parts. 
### Evaluating the model with dynamic benchmarks   
### Grounding language to other modalities
