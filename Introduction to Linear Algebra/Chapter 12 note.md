# Introduction to Linear Algebra
## Chapter 12 Linear Algebra in Probability & Statistics 
### 12.1 Mean, Variance, and Probability
#### Variance (around the mean) 
#### Continuous Probability Distributions 
#### Mean and Variance of $p( x)$
#### Normal Distribution: Bell-shaped Curve 
#### $N$ Coin Flips and $N \to \infty$
#### Monte Carlo Estimation Methods

### 12.2 Covariance Matrices and Joint Probabilities 
#### The Covariance Matrix $V$ is Positive Semidefinite
#### The Mean and Variance of $z = x + y$
#### The Covariance Matrix for $Z = AX$
#### The Correlation $p$
### 12.3 Multivariate Gaussian and Weighted Least Squares
#### Two-dimensional Gaussians
#### Non-independent $x$ and $y$ 
#### Weighted Least Squares
