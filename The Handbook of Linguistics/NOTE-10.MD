## Part 3 Core Fields
### 9 Phonology Sound Structure
#### 1 Introduction 
+ phonology:  which sounds occur, what their distribution is, how they can be combined, and how they might be realized differently in different positions in a word or phrase
+ core: documenting and characterizing the full range of attested sound structures and patterns across the languages of the world.
+ generative phonology:  develop a theory that accurately models a speakerâ€™s knowledge of his or her language.
#### 2 Inventories and Contrasts
##### 2.1 Inventories
+ A sound inventory is the set of sounds occurring in a particular language
+ phonological universals
##### 2.2 Contrast 
+ distinctive/contrast: an important distinction between those sounds that can be used to make meaningful contrasts in a language vs. those  that occur only in predictable contexts
+ Minimal pairs: are words with distinct meanings differing only in one sound
+ phoneme: used distinctively in a particular language
#### 3 Structure Above the Level of the Segment: Prosodic Organization
+ The syllables, feet, and prosodic words together constitute the prosodic structure of a word. 
##### 3.1 Syllable structure 
+ alternation: the same morpheme varies in its realization, conditioned by some aspect of the sound system 
+ Sonority: the degree of constriction in the mouth during the production of a particular sound
+ syllable: onset, rime(nucleus, coda)
  + restrictions on syllable structure in different languages
##### 3.2 A constraint-based account 
+ Optimality Theory: the idea of competing phonological constraints, which can be ranked in importance with respect to one another. Due to such ranking, a less important constraint can be violated in order to obey a more important constraint that it conflicts with. 
  + how different languages handle borrowed words
#### 4 Subsegmental Structure
##### 4.1 Features and segmenthood
+ distinctive features and natural classes
##### 4.2 Alternations
+ Oftentimes phonemes are realized in different ways in different contexts as determined by position in the word, neighboring sounds, (un)stressed position, and so forth
  + assimilation: a sound becomes more similar to its neighbor(s)
  + vowel harmony: vowels agree in a certain property
  + neutralization: contrast between segments can be lost in a particular environment
#### 5 Phonology in a Broader Context 
##### 5.1 Phonology as a system
##### 5.2 Emerging trends and research questions
