### 11 Morphology
#### 1 Introduction
+ Morphology is about the structure of words
+ morpheme and bound morpheme 
##### 1.1 The lexeme concept
+ lexeme: a complex representation linking a (single) meaning with a set of word forms
+ synonymy: a single form corresponds to more than one completely unrelated meaning
+ homophony, homonymy: distinct lexemes which happen to share the same shape (written and/or spoken). 
##### 1.2 Types of word formation: inflection, derivation, compounding
+ inflection,: word forms of lexemes
  + total suppletion: when one inflected form bears no shape relation to the rest of the paradigm
  + express grammatical or functional categories
    + case: the grammatical or semantic role of a noun in a sentence is shown by its form
    + tense: anchoring in time
    + aspect: the manner in which an event unfolds over time.
    + mood: whether a statement is presented as fact, possibility, hypothetical situation, and so on
  +  a verb must agree with its subject and/or object, by crossreferencing various of their properties
  +  government: a transitive verb governs the accusative
+ derivation, new lexemes from old lexemes
+ compounding,a single word is formed by combining two other words. 
  + compounds and phrases
  + noncompositional, can’t determine the meaning of the whole just from the meanings of the parts
  + productive: applies freely in principle to all the lexemes of the language of the relevant type
+ whether there is a clearcut distinction between inflection and derivation and if so how to draw it
##### 1.3 Other types of realization: clitics and periphrases
+ A clitic is a word which has lost some of its syntactic independence and which behaves in some ways like an affix
+ periphrases: a piece of syntax seems to fulfil a role which we would otherwise expect to be fulfilled by inflected morphological forms
  + typical for a to be idiomatic or noncompositional 
  + the periphrase occupies a cell which we would otherwise expect to be filled by a single inflected word form
#### 2 The Morpheme Concept and Agglutinating Morphology
##### 2.1 Item-and-Arrangement morphology 
+ Item-and-Arrangement theory: morphemes are “things” which are arranged in a particular way and which contribute their meaning to the meaning of the whole word. 
+ agglutination: In an “ideal” morphological system each morpheme contributes one meaning and each meaning is associated with just one morpheme 
##### 2.2 Deviations from agglutination
+ concatenative morphology: the addition of a semantically transparent affix to a base
+ nonconcatenative morphology: addition of a meaningful element but rather take the form of a phonological process
###### 2.2.1 Allomorphy
+ e.g. variation of the past tense suffix in English
###### 2.2.2 Processual morphology
+ ablaut or apophony: take the basic root and change the vowel
+ reduplication: morphological categories are signaled by a kind of prefix, which consists of a copy of certain segments of the stem. 
+ subtractive morphology: a morphological category is signaled by loss of a portion of the base
###### 2.2.3 Form‒meaning deviations
1. One morph, two meanings: fusion or cumulation of two separate meanings.
2. One meaning, two morphs: One and the same function can be signaled by different morphs in a given word
3. One meaning, no morph ‒ null morphemes 
4. One morph, no meaning : "cranberry"
#### 3 Morpheme Order 
+ Distributed Morphology : denies the distinction between morphology and syntax: all word structure is really an extension of syntactic structure and the affixes are morphemes compounded with each other by syntactic processes.
#### 4 Rule Function Morphology 
+ Rule Function approach: affixation is just one of a set of phonological operations which can be performed on a base, triggered by the inflectional properties of the whole word, processes are stated as rules which are usually thought of as something like functions in the mathematical sense.
#### 5 Paradigms and Principal Parts
+ paradigm: the word forms of a lexeme together with their grammatical description, usually defined in terms of a feature system. 
+ principal part: a specific grammatical word or set of grammatical words which allows a learner to figure out all the other word forms in the paradigm of that lexeme
#### 6 Lexeme Structure and Lexical Relatedness
##### 6.1 Derivational morphology
+ similitudinal adjectives.
##### 6.2 Four types of lexical relatedness
+ relatedness amongst lexemes by transparent derivational morphology
+ semantic relatedness
+ systematic polysemy: two different lexemes with the same form
+ clear morphological relatedness but no semantic connection 
##### 6.3 Mixed categories
+ participles: adjectival forms associated with verb lexemes, often expressing verbal tenses, aspects, or voices, but not adding any lexical meanings and hence usually considered inflectional forms.
##### 6.4 Complex predicates
+ complex predicates: there is a mismatch between the number of lexemes and the number of syntactically realized word forms. 
  + a single phonological, syntactic word form corresponds to two lexemes and (ii)
  + two phonological, syntactic word forms correspond to one lexeme
