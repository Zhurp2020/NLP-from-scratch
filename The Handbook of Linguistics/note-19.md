### 19 First Language Acquisition
#### 1 Learning Sounds
##### 1.1 Auditory processing and memory
+ In the womb, the fetus can pick up the rhythm of the mother’s voice and the overall cadence of human language
+ human infants were specifically adapted at birth to perceive many sound contrasts.
+ infants have a remarkable capacity to record and store sequences of auditory events.
+ babies also demonstrate preferences for the language that resembles the speech of their mothers. 
+ during the first eight months, the child is learning a lot about the sounds of language. Although the child is not yet learning words, she is acquiring the basic auditory and intonational patterns of her native language. 
##### 1.2 Early articulation 
+ During the first three months, a baby’s vocalizations can be characterized as various types of cries and vegetative adaptations
+ By six months, the baby is producing somewhat more structured vocalizations, including a larger diversity of nasals, vowel types, and syllables with the canonical consonant-vowel structure
+ After six months, babbling relies increasingly on auditory feedback. During this period, the infant tries to produce specific sounds to match up with specific auditory impressions
+ Between six and ten months, there is a tight linkage between babbling and general motoric arousal.
+ By 12 months, there is some slight drift in the direction of the native language, as the infant begins to acquire the first words
#### 2 Learning Words 
##### 2.1 The first words
+ the infant’s growing ability to record the sounds of words
+  development of an ability to control vocal productions that occurs in the late stages of babbling.
+  general growth of the symbolic function, as represented in play, imitation, and object manipulation
##### 2.2 Early semantics
+ children often try to be conservative in their first uses of words, overgeneralization and undergeneralizaion
+ joint attention and shared eye gaze to establish common reference for objects and actions.
+ uses the form of utterances to derive the meanings of new words.
##### 2.3 Mutual exclusivity and competition
+ Mutual exclusivity: each object can only have one name. If a child hears a second name for the old object, she can either reject the new name as wrong, or else find some distinction that disambiguates the new name from the old.
+ Mutual exclusivity is clearly not a basic property of natural language. 
+ child thinks in terms of the pragmatics of mutual cooperation. When two words are in head-on conflict and no additional disambiguating cues are provided, it makes sense for the child to assume that the adult is being reasonable and using the new name for the new object. 
##### 2.4 Humpty-Dumpty and Whorf
+ Children often have a rather fixed agenda of items to be expressed and would love to find simple ways of expressing each of those items
+ the presence of obligatory grammatical markings in languages for concepts such as tense, aspect, number, gender, and definiteness can orient the child’s thinking in certain paths at the expense of others
#### 3 Learning Grammar
##### 3.1 The first word combinations
+ For several months, the child produces isolated single words
+ linkage of predicates to arguments is the first step in syntactic development
+ it appears that children rely on some uniquely human ability for structuring combinations of predicates and arguments into tighter syntactic combinations. 
##### 3.2 Missing glue 
+ the first sentences include only the most important words, without any of the glue
+ the child makes sure that the most important and substantive parts of the communication are not omitted
+ Children tend to preserve frequent word combinations
+ Children tend to preserve frequent word combinations
##### 3.3 Productivity
+ Productivity can be demonstrated in the laboratory by teaching children names for new objects.
+ Three-year-olds also demonstrate some limited productive use of syntactic patterns for new verbs. However, children tend to be conservative and unsure about how to use verbs productively until about age five. 
+ The control of productivity is based on two complementary sets of cues: semantics and cooccurrence
##### 3.4 The logical problem of language acquisition 
+ children may often ignore parental feedback regarding the form of language
##### 3.5 Lexical groups 
##### 3.6 Errors that never occur
##### 3.7 Emergentist accounts
+ Neural Network
#### 4 A Fourth Perspective
+ Nearly 1 out of 20 children suffers from some form of language impairment.
