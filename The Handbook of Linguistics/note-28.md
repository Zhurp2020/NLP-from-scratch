### 28 Second Language Pedagogy Where Theory Meets Practice
#### 1 Methodologies
+ Grammar translation took as a starting point language as discrete grammatical points and vocabulary items that are best learned through the medium of the first language. 
+ The audiolingual approach took spoken language as primary, and the model of spoken language must be the native speaker. It presupposed that language learning was a process of habit formation best accomplished through imitation and repetition to eliminate the possibility of error.
+ communicative language teaching (CLT). In CLT, language is conceptualized as not just a framework within the learner’s head but a communicative system that relies on use within a social context. Thus, language includes not just grammar rules or correct pronunciation but the way in which individuals interact effectively with each other. 
#### 2 Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)
##### 2.1 Communicative Language Teaching (CLT)
+ communicative competence: the ideal native speaker does not exist, speech communities are not homogeneous, and language cannot be divorced from its sociocultural uses for communication
+ comprehensible input refers to input that is slightly beyond the learners’ existing competence but is nonetheless understandable
+ Natural Approach distinguishes learning, which they view as superficial knowledge about the target language, from acquisition, which they view as the deeper knowledge how to use the target language
+ structural syllabus, which is organized according to pre-set grammar points. PPP – standing for presentation, practice, production
##### 2.3 CLT applications: content-based instruction (CBI) and task-based instruction (TBI)
+ language is best learned when the language itself is the tool for doing something rather than the object of learning. 
+ content-based instruction refers to the integration of language learning with content.
+ task-based instruction rests on the belief that the purpose of learning language is language use, and that learning takes place by making use of language
##### 2.4 Criticisms of CLT, CBI, and TBI
+ CLT embodies values and expectations of individualism and creativity on the part of the students that may be at odds with prevailing educational traditions and culture
#### 3 The Postmethods Era
+ postmethod condition as: a search for an alternative to the confinement of a single set of practices inherent in adoption of a method; an acceptance of teacher autonomy that allows teachers to respond to their own academic and administrative contexts; and a recognition of principled pragmatism that allows teachers to choose practices that are engaging and effective for their particular students.
