### 9 Linguistic Phonetics The Sounds of Languages
#### 1 Introduction 
+ phonetics: the scientific study of the nature, use, and variety of all aspects of speech
+ phonology: the study of communicative aspects of spoken language
#### 2 Linguistic Phonetics and General Phonetic Theory
+ center: describe the phonetic correlates of phonological units of spoken language and their interactions.
##### 3 The Scope of Linguistic Phonetics
1. describing the phonetic basis for differentiating all contrastive and contextual patterns in speech which signal the identities of linguistic units in any given language; 
2. describing the phonetic regularities which distinguish the speech styles of a given sociolinguistic community from those of others within any given language; 
3. describing the idiosyncratic but characteristic phonetic events which distinguish the speech of one member of any given sociolinguistic community from that of other members; 
4. describing all recurrent aspects of speech that make one language sound different from others. 
#### 4 The Coverage of a Linguistic Phonetic Theory 
+ there is a core of frequently used sounds that turn up repeatedly in widely different language families
  + Perceptual stability: tending to use sounds for which small articulatory adjustments make little auditory difference. 
  + adequate perceptual contrast: avoiding sound differences close to the limits of human discrimination. 
  + Ease and economy of articulation: choosing sound types which do not unduly tax the capabilities of the speech production system. 
  + Ecological robustness: the ability of sounds to resist the perceptual masking effects of other sounds likely to be heard in the environment
  + ease of modifiability to the needs of the communicative situation: parameters of speech control are used which can be appropriately modified without damaging intelligibility. 
##### 5 The Shape of a General Phonetic Theory
+ the posited features and organizational units cover the maximum range of data with the simplest descriptive constructs. 
#### 6 Organic and Phonetic Aspects of Speech
+ Organic factors: to do with anatomical structure or morphology, and with the constraints which that structure imposes on the potential for physiological action
+ Phonetic factors: arise from any learnable aspect of use of the vocal apparatus, with its acoustic and perceptual correlates
+ phonetic similarity: metric for comparing the phonetic characteristics of any two sounds.
  + the basis, within a single speaker, for grouping phonetically similar allophonic variants into a single phoneme
  + the range of phonetic segment types that can be represented by a given character in alphabetically based writing systems for whole language communities. 
#### 7 Articulatory, Acoustic, and Perceptual Levels of Description of Speech
+  articulatory level: changing configurations and other actions of the speaker’s vocal apparatus. 
+ acoustic level: the physical consequences of articulatory actions in terms of vibratory patterns of air molecules within the vocal apparatus and in the air between the speaker and the listener.
+ perceptual level: impressions of the listener receiving the acoustic information. 
#### 8 Linear and Nonlinear Units of Speech Organization
+ tend to be continuous
+ natural breaks
  + at the beginning and end of a speaking turn
  + at the beginning and end of an individual utterance
##### 8.1 The relationship between phonetic segments and phonetic features as units of speech production
+ In the minimum case, two segments may differ from each other by the presence or absence of just one phonetic feature
##### 8.2 Phonetic and phonological features 
##### 8.3 The phonological syllable
+ for the location of word-identifying patterns of stress
+ an organizing concept for the mutual distribution of vowels and consonants. 
#### 9 The Componential Organization of Speech Production 
#### 10 Speech Production Processes 
##### 10.1 initiation and direction of airflow
+ pulmonic mechanism
  + egressive/ingressive
+ glottalic airstream mechanism. 
  + glottalic egressive airstream: ejectives
  + glottalic ingressive airstream: implosives
+ velaric airstream mechanism.
  + velaric ingressive airstream: clicks
##### 10.2 phonation type;
+ voiceless: the triangular space of the glottis is left wide open, as if for breathing out.
+ whisper: the vocal folds are brought close enough together to make the continuous airflow through them turbulent, either through a gap left at the back or through a narrowed glottis
+ voiced: vibration of the vocal folds
+ creak: the front part of the glottis vibrates, at a considerably lower frequency than in normal voicing, while the back part is pressed more tightly together
+ whispery: the vocal folds do not completely seal off the transglottal escape of the pulmonic airflow while vibrating, but leave a gap – either at the back of the glottal triangle, or along the length of the approximated but vibrating vocal folds
+ glottal stop: closure of the vocal folds
##### 10.3 articulation;
###### 10.3.1 closure of the vocal folds
+ onset phase: the active articulator is approaching the maximum stricture
+ medial phase
+ offset phase: moving away from this toward the configuration for the medial 
phase of the next segment
###### 10.3.2 Place of articulation 
+ neutral configuration: the vocal tract is as nearly as anatomy allows in equal cross-section along its full length from lips to pharynx
  + labial, dental closure, alveolar, velar
+ displaced articulations
  + labiodental, apicoalveolar, linguolabial
###### 10.3.3 Degree of stricture
+ stops: complete articulatory closure
+ fricatives: close approximation
+ resonants: open approximation
###### 10.3.4 Aspect of articulation
+ conformational aspects: the routing of the airflow channel. 
  + oral/nasal 
  + central/lateral
  + single/multiple 
  + double articulation: When two such strictures are of equal degree 
  + primary/secondary articulation: When one stricture is of greater degree than the other during the shared medial phase
+ topographical aspects: the shape of the tongue
+ transitional aspects: whether the active articulator is static during the medial phase of the articulation, or in dynamic movement
##### 10.4 Intersegmental coordination
###### 10.4.1 Aspiration
+  audible delay in the onset of voicing after the end of the stricture of the medial phase, in the overlap phase between the stop and the resonant.
###### 10.4.2 Stop release
+ The offset phase of any oral stop may release the compressed air built up during the medial phase in a variety of ways. Alternatively, the stop may be incomplete, and lack a final release
###### 10.4.3 Affrication 
+ The stop closure is released more slowly than in a nonaffricated stop, so that a brief moment of audible friction is heard as the stricture passes momentarily from complete closure through close approximation. 
###### 10.4.4 Coarticulation and assimilation
+ that one segment may influence the articulatory characteristics of segments yet to be spoken, or be influenced by those that precede it. When such an  influence crosses a word boundary, it is said to result in assimilation; when it is restricted to word-internal action, it is said to show coarticulation.
