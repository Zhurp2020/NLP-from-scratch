###  24 Sociolinguistic Theory Systematic Study of the Social Uses of Language
#### 1 Concept and Percept
+ The essence of language as social act is the manipulation of linguistic elements for communicative purposes.
#### 2 The Science of Parole
##### 2.1 The variable as structural unit
+ gather evidence of variability on a large scale and demonstrate that its occurrence in the speech community was systematic, patterned, and orderly. 
#### 3  Social Correlates
##### 3.1 Social classes
+ Social classes are abstract stratifying categories primarily determined by the intersection of education, occupation, and income
+ predictable structural relationship between standard and nonstandard varieties
#### 4  Social networks 
+ Social networks are microlevel social clusters such as neighborhoods, parishes, institutions, and clubs. They resemble social classes in the sense that they are made up of people with similar social attributes, but they are more narrowly construed and more intimate.
+ Socially, networks are norm-enforcement mechanisms; 
+ The higher the Network Strength Scale, the greater the use of local vernacular variants, and vice     versa.
##### 3.3 Sex and gender
+ sex  is a biological  given; gender is a social acquisition 
+ Sex differences are visible from conception but become more visible from puberty onward. Gender differences are largely invisible
+ societies, male and female differences are sex-preferential rather than sexexclusive.
+ In mainstream societies, differences in sex-preferential variation are often class-based, especially between middle-class and other strata.
##### 3.4 Ethnicity 
+ distinctive linguistic features often come into being as a function of social segregation on the one hand and identity construction on the other
##### 3.5 Age
+ Sociolinguistic theories,  view change in apparent time, by comparing speech of people of different ages in the community and inferring from observed differences that linguistic change is in progress. 
+ Cumulative evidence shows that prototypical language changes are accelerated by adolescents and led by women
+ S-curve, a pattern that is relatively flat at both start and finish, and linked by a rapid rise in the middle
