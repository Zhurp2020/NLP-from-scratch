# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 1 Starting Points
### 3 Typology and Universals
#### 1  Introduction: The Typological and Generative Approaches to Language Universals
+ typological approach is fundamentally crosslinguistic in nature, it examines a broad sample of languages in order to discover universals of language structure and propose explanations for those language universals.
+ Using a more systematic sampling of a substantial number of languages, typology reveals not only the range of variation but constraints on that variation. 
+ The typological approach is basically inductive and empirical.
+ Only by assessing a broad sample can we see:
  + the significance of different properties of linguistic structure 
  + whether a causal connection exists between two grammatical properties
+ example: verbal inflection and copula
  + the universal governing occurrence of a copula is based on the semantic type of predication: if predicate adjectives require a copula in a language, then predicate nominals  require a copula as well
#### 2 How Many Languages Are Needed for a Typological Study?
+ Primary goals and models
  + to reveal the diversity of linguistic structures: a variety sample
  + to discover statistically  valid causal connections between linguistic traits: a probability sample
+ Variety sample:   
  + maximize the likelihood of capturing all the diversity of the construction in question
  + as many different language families and different geographical regions as possible
  +  supplemented by surveys of families in which the construction being examined is changing. 
+ Probability sample:
  + capture the relevant properties of the population as a whole
  + random sample of languages whose relevant traits are independent.
  + Problems:
    + not completely random
    + cannot guarantee that all  cases are independent
+ take historical relatedness into consideration when constructing and evaluating language universals.
+ use mixed effect models to consider the effect of language family membership and geographical proximity
#### 3 How Does One Person Use Data from So Many Languages?
+ a reference grammar: 
  + reference source for the major grammatical constructions of the language.
  + interlinear morpheme translation
  + there are gaps in the data
+ questionnaires and experimental elicitation techniques
  + allows directly eliciting the constructions expressing the function investigated.
  + designing is extremely difficult
  + can benefit from a broader description of the language than just the constructions under investigation.
#### 4 How Can One Compare Grammatical Structures from Many Different Languages? 
+ basis: meaning or function
+ function:
  + avoid problems arising from the usage of traditional grammatical terminology
  + can compare grammatical structures by using different grammatical categories across languages
+ e.g.: different alignment system
  + categories of meanings that are more frequent in discourse are likely to be encoded with fewer morphemes
  + linguistic form is separate from linguistic function, and that linguistic form is at least partly arbitrary
#### 5 The Nature of Language Universals
+ design features/unrestricted language universals: 'All languages have X'
+ implicational universals,  “If a language has X, then it also has Y.”
+ e.g. noun-adjective order and noun-numeral order
  + there exist universal properties of language that do not require all languages to be identical in specific properties
  + constraints on language variation that are represented by implicational universals are not exceptionless in the way that the design features of language are
+ Different models:
  + competing motivations model: posits two or more factors that determine language structure
  + Log-linear analysis: construct a model of the simultaneous interactions between many word orders
  + semantic map model (conceptual space): identify language universals without assuming that grammatical categories are the same across languages
#### 6 Explanations for Language Universals
+ language processing in production and comprehension:  language processing in production and comprehension
+ diachronic explanation: the actual grammatical constructions used for different word orders are historically related.
+ patterns of the expression of grammatical relations and constructions: based on a universal conceptual space that represents the degree of conceptual relatedness of the situations or concepts represented by the points in the conceptual space
+ competing motivations of economy and iconicity
  + economic: the more frequently occurring form is expressed by fewer morphemes
  + conic: the relationship between form and function
  + both extremely common crosslinguistically
+ evolutionary models: of how language structures adapt to the functions they perform in communication and the constraints on comprehension and production of utterances in language use
