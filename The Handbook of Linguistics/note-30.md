### 30 Linguistics and Reading
#### 1 Bottom-Up and Top-Down Processing in Reading
+ Bottom-up processes take in information from the outside world – symbols of a writing system, in the case of reading – and deal with that information with little recourse to higher-level knowledge. 
+ With top-down processes, on the other hand, uptake of information is guided by people’s prior knowledge and expectations.
+ Theories that stress bottom-up processing focus on how readers extract information from the printed page, claiming that readers deal with letters and words in a relatively complete and systematic fashion 
+ Theories that stress top-down processing claim that readers form hypotheses about which words they will encounter and take in only just enough visual information to test their hypotheses.
+ the eye comes to rest for somewhere around a quarter of a second, in what is called a fixation, and then makes a rapid jump (called a saccade) to the next fixation. It is during the fixation that visual stimulation is taken in; little or no useful information is extracted during a saccade
#### 2 Word Recognition
+ processing of printed words involves the recovery of the words’ linguistic forms. Readers often access the phonological (or sound) forms of words as part of the recognition process. This phonological activation is covert, for skilled readers who are reading silently,
+ rapid, automatic word recognition is critical to reading success and that such recognition often involves activation of words’ spoken forms
+ dual-route type claim that skilled readers read words via both lexical and nonlexical routes. When using the lexical route, a reader looks up a word in her mental lexicon and accesses the pronunciation, if it has previously been stored there. When using the nonlexical route, the reader assembles a pronunciation using rules that, according to most dual-route models, relate individual graphemes to individual phonemes in an all-or-none manner.
#### 3 Learning to Read
+ whole language: Children should focus on the meaning of what they read rather than laboriously sounding out the individual words, focus on the meaning and purpose of printed language rather than on the individual letters and sounds  
+ phonics: The phonics approach thus focuses on individual letters and sounds, repetition, and practice
+ reading problems
  + a lack of phonemic awareness. Children’s attention is normally on the meaning of what they hear and say, not on the individual words and sounds
  + when they first begin to learn to read, they may believe that the links between printed words and concepts are arbitrary
  + teachers are themselves good readers, they tend to think about language in terms of how it is spelled rather than how it is pronounced
#### 4 Learning to Spell
+ However, research shows that children are less likely to learn words’ spellings from the reading of meaningful, connected text than from the study of isolated words
#### 5 Dyslexia
+ dyslexics have weaknesses in the phonological component of language . Specifically, dyslexics have difficulty becoming aware of the phonemic structure of spoken language and thus have trouble learning about the way in which spellings map onto words’ sounds in alphabetic writing systems.
