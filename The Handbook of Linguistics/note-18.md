### 16  Sign Languages
+ the study of natural languages in a different physical modality confirms in a novel way the hypothesis that all natural human languages are characterized by certain key properties
+ this study raises fundamental questions about the human language capacity, as well as challenges for language theory, that we would never have noticed were it not for the existence of sign languages. 
+ Sign languages are not derived from spoken languages; they have their own independent vocabularies and their own grammatical structures. 
#### 1 Linguistic Structure of Sign Languages 
##### 1.1 Sentence structure: Syntax 
+ subordination
+ flexible word order
+ Coordinate Structure Constraint:: disallows extraction of material out of a coordinated structure
##### 1.2 The structure of sounds and their sign language equivalents: Phonology
+ analyzable as a combination of three meaningless yet linguistically significant categories: handshapes, locations, and movements. 
+ prosody
##### 1.3 Word structure: Morphology
+ All established sign languages investigated so far show a comparable kind of verb agreement
+ backwards verbs, the movement of the hand is from the object to the subject, instead of the usual direction from subject to object.
+ classifier predicates: handshapes that stand for classes of nouns combine with different types and manners of movements and with locations in space. The handshapes of classifier constructions often classify nominal referents according to physical properties like size or shape
#### 2 Language as an Art Form: Sign Language Poetry
#### 3 The Acquisition of Sign Languages 
+  children begin to use their first words at around 11 months of age
+  use their first signs at around 6 to 8 months of age
+   the use of two-word(/sign) combinations, seems to be attained at around 18 months for both signing and speaking children. 
+   Researchers find that even after 50 years of signing, people who were exposed to ASL only after the age of 5 systematically differ in their use of some of the complex mechanisms of ASL, as compared with similar-aged adults who acquired ASL from birth in signing homes.
+   human brain will create a communication system as soon as people congregate and have a need to communicate
#### 4 Neural Control of Sign Languages
