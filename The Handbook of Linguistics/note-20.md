### 20 Pragmatics Language and Communication
#### 1 The Puzzle of Language Use: How Do We Ever Understand Each Other?
+ describe things by using words in ways which only have a very indirect relation to what a dictionary would indicate is their meaning
+ How is it that using language is in general so effortless, when there seems to be no limit to what words can convey or what ambiguities they can give rise to?
+ This study is based on the assumption of a division between knowledge of language and the way it is used; and the goal of pragmatics is taken to be that of providing a set of principles which dictate how knowledge of language and general reasoning interact in the process of language understanding, to give rise to the various different kinds of effects which can be achieved in communication
#### 2 Pragmatics as the Application of Conversational Principles to Sentence Meanings
+ This approach to pragmatics can be summed up as the view that a grammar of a language provides a characterization of meaning for each individual sentence as articulated in some semantic theory, and that pragmatic principles apply to the output of the grammar-internal characterization to yield its full import in context. 
##### 2.1 Knowledge of language: sentence meanings as partial specifications of interpretation 
+ relevance theory: Pragmatic theory explains how such incomplete specifications are enriched in context to yield the full communicative effect of an uttered sentence, whether metaphorical, ironical, and so on
##### 2.2 Knowledge of language: a set of procedures for interpreting utterances
#### 3 The Process of Reasoning: How Do Hearers Ever Manage to Choose the Right Interpretation? 
##### 3.1 Grice’s cooperative principle and the conversational maxims 
+ the interpretation of utterances is a collaborative enterprise guided by a “cooperative principle” in which a speaker and hearer are engaged in some shared goal. This collaborative enterprise is structured by a number of maxims, which speakers are presumed to obey
+  interpretation was thereby taken to be better understood, divided up into two distinct phenomena, the concept of meaning for sentences, and the concept of meaning for utterances
