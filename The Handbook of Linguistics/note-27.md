###  27 7 Second Language Acquisition One Person with Two Languages
#### 1 Overall Issues
#### 2 Early Days: Links and Questions
+ A coordinate bilingual has two separate concepts for a word: two concepts, two words
+ Compound bilinguals on the other hand have a single concept
+ it is believed that both types of bilingualism are present to varying extents
+ Transfer means carrying over the forms and meanings of one language to another, resulting in interference – “instances of deviation from the norms of either language which occur in the speech of bilinguals as a result of their familiarity with more than one language” 
+ maximal” : “native-like control of two languages
+ “minimal” : “the point where a speaker can first produce complete meaningful utterances in the other language” 
+ L2 learners also build up grammars of their own that are not part of either the first language or the second but have an independent existence
#### 3 What Is the Sequence of L2 Acquisition? 
+ there are indeed sequences of L2 acquisition in different areas of language and with different first languages
#### 4 	What Are the Similarities between L2 Learning and L1 Acquisition? 
#### 5 Does Age Affect L2 Learning?
+ “additive” L2 learning adds new skills and experiences to the L2 users’ lives, 
+ “subtractive” L2 learning detracts from their present state by, say, making them ashamed of their first language. 
+ critical period hypothesis 
+ Age does seem to have effects on L2 learning but their exact nature is unclear and their causes are mostly speculative. 
#### 6 Do L2 Learners Attain the Same Level of Language as Native Speakers? 
+ The balance of the research to date suggests that a small proportion of L2 learners can acquire the same knowledge of a language as native speakers, just as a small group seem able to acquire a native-like accent.
#### 7 How Important Is Transfer to L2 Learning? 
#### 8 What Is the Relationship between Universal Grammar and Second Language Acquisition?
+ The main question has been whether L2 learners have access to Universal Grammar or have to manage without it; in other words, is L2 learning like L1 learning? 
#### 9 What Is the Role of Language Input?
+ In the UG theory, some language input is necessary in acquisition in order to set the parameters and to acquire vocabulary. 
+ A more radical view is that negative evidence is needed in L2 acquisition even if irrelevant to L1 acquisition.
+ How people interact with learners may help them acquire the language.  “the process in which, in an effort to communicate, learners and competent speakers provide and interpret signals of their own and their interlocutor’s perceived comprehension” 
#### 10 What Strategies and Processes Do L2 Learners Use?
+ good learners tend to adopt the learning style that suits them, to involve themselves in the language learning process, and so on
+ “metacognitive strategies” for managing thinking, such as monitoring one’s speech, “cognitive strategies” for thinking itself, such as note-taking, and “social strategies” which involve other people, such as asking for help
+  students remember vocabulary best when they make associations and learn cognates.
#### 11 How Are the Two Languages Related in the Mind?
+ code-switching in which the speaker changes language in midstream, sometimes between sentences but often within the bounds of the same sentence
+ one is the monolingual mode in which one or other of the two languages is employed, the other is the bilingual mode in which both languages are used at once.
+ “free morpheme constraint” is that the speaker may not switch language between a word and its inflection unless the word is pronounced as if it were in the language of the ending;
+ “equivalence constraint” is that the switch-point must not violate the grammar of either language;
+ “government” model of code-switching proposed that the switch cannot come within a maximal phrase
+  4M Model sees code-switching in terms of a matrix language and an embedded language. 
+  L2 users can separate the two languages, consciously choosing which language to use
