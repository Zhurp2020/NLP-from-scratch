# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 1 Starting Points
### 3 Field Linguistics Gathering Language Data from  Native Speakers 
#### 1  What Is “Field Linguistics”?
+ the collection of primary data on the basic grammatical  facts of a relatively little studied language from ordinary speakers in a relatively natural setting, and the analysis and dissemination of such data
+ not normally based on introspection
#### 2 How Is “Field” Data Gathered? 
##### 2.1 Basic techniques of field linguistics
+ elicitation: uses an intermediary language in order to ask for translations of words, phrases, and sentences in the “target” language.
+ natural volunteered data: text analysis, observing natural conversations
+ simple elicitation can create unnatural or skewed data. Elicitation and textual analysis are important complements to each other
+ Serendipitous events can produce spontaneous types of language that are hard to elicit and that may never appear in texts. 
  + e.g. special expressions towards a baby
##### 2.2 Getting started with fieldwork
###### 2.2.1 The field methods class
+ students meet with a speaker of an unfamiliar language and elicit forms which they transcribe and analyze
+ learn politeness or respect
+ steps:
  + transcribe the phonological system of the language
  + work out how subjects and objects of different persons and numbers are marked
      + e.g. identifying different sets of suffixes
      + look for patterns and to accept that the data may be complex if that is the only consistent explanation
  + analyzing a text from the speaker
  +  more extended grammatical description and analysis
###### 2.2.2 Finding a speaker
+ Personal contacts and serendipity
+ consider how you will tell that person about your work and goals.
#### 3 What to Ask a Speaker, and What a Speaker Says 
+ Having too much of an agenda or coming to the work with too many assumptions can produce unexpected results.
+ do a general survey of as many features of basic grammar as possible
+ review existing descriptions
+ start with simple words in isolation in order to develop a feeling for the phonetics
+ it is dangerous to elicit out of context
+ note down comments from the speaker
##### 3.1 Working in the field 
###### 3.1.1 Fieldwork can be done anywhere 
+ worry: whether that person still commands his or her language as well as someone with the support of a whole community
+ work with more than one speaker
###### 3.1.2 Linguistics in the field is more than linguistics
+ be willing to participate
###### 3.1.3 Technology and the field worker
#### 4 Analyzing the Data, and What to Do with It
##### 4.1 Basic analysis 
+ describe what you do know
+ analysis must be ongoing
##### 4.2 Writing the language
+ arrive at an understanding of the language’s basic phonology
+ develop a clear phonemic orthography
+ also a practical orthography
##### 4.3 Describing the language 
+ a duty to publish
+ produce a grammar, a dictionary, and a collection of texts.
+ solid understanding of the workings not just of the language being described, but also of language in general. 
#### 5 Contributions of Field Linguistics to Linguistic  Theory and other Scholarly Work
+ good description advances the theory by “testing” it, examining the way in which new data can be presented within current models, and showing how those claims must be extended and modified to handle new facts.
#### 6 The Highest Contribution 
+ preserve languages that may  otherwise pass away
