# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 1 Starting Points
### 5 Writing systems
#### 1 The Diversity of Writing Systems
+ Key: primacy of syllable, a five way typology
  + logosyllabary: each character stands for a morpheme, and the characters can be used for the sound of the morpheme as well as for its meaning
  + syllabary: each character stands for a syllable
  + abjadz: each character stands for a consonant
  + alphabet: each character stands for a consonant or a vowel
  + abugida: each character stands for a consonant accompanied by a particular vowel, usually /a/, and the other vowels are indicated by consistent additions to the consonant symbol
##### 1.1 Syllabaries
+ e.g. Cherokee, Vai, Caroline Islands and Alaska
+ omission, either systematic or practical, of certain phonemic information
+ the resemblance of some characters in shape, though never in sound, to letters of the roman alphabet
+ something fundamental primal about the syllable, especially the CV syllable
##### 1.2 Alphabets
+ Earliest: Greek
+ isolation of vowels and consonants, and lack of distinction in the treatment of them
+ a one-to-one correspondence between the letters of the alphabet and the phonemes of the language.
+ methods against changes
  + ignore 
  + periodically adjust the spelling conventions
  + orthographic standards set by influential individuals
+ sound change, and foreign influence
+ a synchronic assimilatory sound change, and a morphophonemic spelling
+ Why Greek letters are special:
  +  the various Greek dialects used some letters in different ways and tacked on extra letters as needed
  + local peoples preferred to have distinctive alphabets of their own
  + alpha and beta, provide the word alphabet
##### 1.3 Abjads
+ e.g. Arabic, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic
+ individual communities diverge 
+ conservatism in spelling
+ supplementary systems for vowels, but only in sacred texts
##### 1.4 Abugidas
+ e.g. devanagari, Ethiopic, Indic, Meroitic
+ the vowel additions can occur above, left of, right of, or below the consonant, while the vowel is always pronounced after the consonant
+ Situation of closed syllable
  + the final consonant can simply be omitted
  + e final consonant can be written with a letter for the consonant plus an arbitrary vowel that is skipped over when reading
  + a mark at the end of a word
  + successive consonants are combined into a single symbol. 
##### 1.5 Morphosyllabaries
+ Only Chinese and Japanese
##### 1.6 Informed inventions
+ Korean: consonant and vowel letters belong to distinctive visual sets
+ Algonnquain, Dene, Eskimo:  the four vowels are denoted by the same shape in four different orientations
+ N'ko script: all consonants and vowels are written, with tone indicators in the form of marks above the line of letters
+ phonetic notations
#### 2 The Unity of Writing Systems
+ Writing is a system of more or less permanent marks used to represent an utterance in such a way that the utterance can be recovered more or less exactly without the intervention of the utterer
##### 2.1 Origin of writing
+ All new writing systems invented by nonliterates who know that writing exists are syllabaries. This suggests that syllables might be paramount in grammatogeny. 
+ All three languages involved in creations of writing systems from nothing share a typological similarity. They are essentially monosyllabic
##### 2.2 Diffusion of writing
+ geographical and chronological
###### 2.2.1 Diffusion by adoption
+ e.g. Aramaic,  adjustments were made to bring the script in line with each language’s consonant inventory
###### 2.2.2 Diffusion by adaptation
+ Aramaic and Prakrit, Mongolian hPags-pa: rich grammatical tradition 
+ real innovation in script transfer must be primed by grammatical understanding of the language that is to be written
###### 2.2.3 Diffusion by misunderstanding 
+ Sumerian and Egyptian: the Sumerian signs, for Egyptian represented only the consonants
+ Semitic: used the initial sounds of Semitic words that named the items shown by the Egyptian pictograms.
+ Greek and Phoenician: alphabets
##### 2.3 External characteristics 
+ a constant struggle between economy of material and effort on the one hand, and ease of legibility on the other
+ influenced by the materials on which and with which they are written
+ various reading orders
+ a canonical order in which the signs are learned and which becomes an organizing principle for lists
#### 3 Writing and Language
+ Writing systems, unlike languages, do not all operate in the same way. 
+ Writing systems do not work like linguistic systems; there is no “emic” level, and the popular  term grapheme is misleading. 
+ Language is constantly changing, while writing generally obeys tradition and does not readily respond to changes. 
+ Writing systems can be altered by fiat; languages cannot
+ Writing systems can be altered by fiat; languages cannot
