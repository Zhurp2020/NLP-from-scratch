### 7 Generative Grammar Rule Systems for Describing Sentence Structure 
#### 1 Introduction 
##### 1.1 “Grammar”
+ To most people: what constitutes correct language use.
+ Linguists: structural properties of language that have evolved naturally and that native speakers of the language have mastered without explicit instruction
##### 1.2 “Generative”
+ think of grammars as devices that put pieces of sentences together according to precise rules, thereby “generating” well-formed sentences.
#### 2 Tenets of Generative Grammar
##### 2.1 Grammars should be descriptive, not prescriptive
##### 2.2 Grammars should characterize competence, not performance.
##### 2.3 Grammars should be fully explicit.
##### 2.4 Linguistic analyses should be maximally general.
##### 2.5 The theory of grammar should make universal claims.
##### 2.6 Grammars should be psychologically relevant. 
#### 3 Common Formal Elements 
##### 3.1 Context-free grammar
+ assumption: words can be classified into categories, based on their morphological properties, distributional patterns, and their meanings.
+ words in sentences are grouped into phrases, which themselves are grouped together into larger phrases
+ two parts
  + A lexicon, consisting of a list of words, with their associated grammatical categories. 
  + A set of rules of the form $A\to\Phi$ where $A$ is a phrasal category, and $\Phi$ stands for any string of lexical and/or phrasal categories
##### 3.2 Transformational grammar
+ transformations: rules that modified 
the trees in precisely specified ways  
e.g reflective questions and imperative sentences
##### 3.3 Other enhancements to CFG
+ addition of a semantic component.
+ nonatomic category labels for words and phrases
+ feature structures
  + permits efficient reference to classes of categories. 
#### 4 Some Phenomena Studied by Generative Grammarians
##### 4.1 Binding principles
+ reflexive pronoun must have a local antecedent. 
+ A nonreflexive pronoun may not have a local antecedent
##### 4.2 Filler-gap dependencies
+ dependencies between elements that may be far apart
+ a rule that moves wh-phrases to the front of the sentence, mediated by the intervening material. 
##### 4.3 Island constraints  
+ a number of constraints on the relative positions in which fillers and their corresponding gaps may appear.
#### 5 Varieties of Generative Grammar 
##### 5.1 Transformational theories
+ exploring the wider implications of transformational analyses. 
+ are not used in going from the surface form of a sentence to its meaning
+ largely unable to find behavioral evidence for the psychological reality of the intermediate stages of transformational derivations. 
##### 5.2 Nontransformational analyses
