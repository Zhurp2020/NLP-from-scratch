### 15 Historical Linguistics Language Change Over Time
#### 1 Introduction
+ demonstrated empirically through a comparison of a single language at different stages in its history
+ the differences are considerable and noticeable
+ it does not take a trained specialist to be aware of language change
+ concerned with language change in general and with specific changes in languages, and in particular with describing them, with cataloging them, and, ultimately, with explaining them
+ study of synchronic variation, though associated with quantitative sociolinguistics, a window into change in progress, especially on the assumption that an innovation, whether internally caused or introduced through contact with speakers of other languages, starts in a restricted part of a speech community and then spreads 
+ a speculative one, into the past, and it is associated with reconstruction of earlier language states and with working out the relationships among languages that give clues to how they came to be as they are
+ uniformitarian principle: The general processes and principles which can be noticed in observable history are applicable in all stages of language history
#### 2 Framing the Issues
+ “constraints” problem: what general constraints on change, if any, there are that determine possible and impossible changes and directions of change
+ “transition” problem: seeks to answer by what route language changes
+ “embedding” problem: how a given language change is embedded in the surrounding system of linguistic and social relations. 
+ “evaluation” problem: how members of a speech community evaluate a given change, and what the effect of this evaluation is on the change.
+ “actuation” problem: why a given linguistic change occurred at the particular time and place it did.
#### 3 Substance of Change: What Types Occur? How Do They Spread?
+ virtually all aspects of a language are subject to change
+ not all innovations take hold and spread so as to become changes in a whole speech community; restricted spread of an innovation can lead to the formation of dialects within a larger speech community
+ some changes are found to occur again and again, independently, in language after language, thus giving a basis for deeming such a change to be a natural one.
#### 4 Mechanisms of Change: How Is Change Manifested in Language?
+ through changes in the behavior of speakers, in that a word comes to be pronounced in a different way, used in a novel construction, extended in meaning, and so on
+  couched in a particular theoretical framework and the formalism associated with that framework
+ where change starts in a speech community and where it ends up
#### 5 Explanation of Change: Why Does It Happen?
+ psychological or cognitive factors: analogy, which can be described as the influence of one form or class of forms over another
+ physiological factors
+ systemic factors
+ social factors: e directly sensitive to speakers’ place in society and their relationship with other speakers, in particular terms of address and epithets
#### 6 Some Dramatic Discoveries and Important Methods
+ language relatedness: at least some of the known languages show certain similarities because they represent later instantiations of a once single speech community
+ comparative method: corresponding features are compared with an eye to determining a set of systematic relationships that hold among the languages being compared
#### 7 For the Future: What Remains to Be Done?
+ the histories of numerous individual languages
+ development of a clear characterization of naturalness, and thus feed into the development of a general theory of language change
+ the origin of language
+ whether a general theory of change is possible
