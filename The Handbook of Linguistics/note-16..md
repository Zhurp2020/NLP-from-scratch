### 16 Neurolinguistics
+ language disorders (aphasiology) and the relationship between language and the brain. 
+ Aphasiology has made important discoveries about what goes wrong with language after brain damage, some of which have implications for what language is and how it is processed.
#### 1 Aphasiology
##### 1.1 A very brief history of aphasiology
+ to think of language disorders as disorders of the ability to use language in the usual tasks of speaking, understanding, reading, and writing.
+ Broca, “classic” clinically defined aphasic syndromes
#### 1.2 Modern aphasiology
+ sees human language as a code that links a set of linguistic forms to a number of aspects of meaning. These forms are activated in the usual tasks of language use – speaking, auditory comprehension, reading, and writing – by different “components” of a “language processing system.”
+ lexical level, the morphological level, the sentential level, and the discourse level are all activated in parallel in the acts of speaking, understanding, reading, and writing. 
##### 1.3  Disturbances of word meanings 
+  most concepts are not easily described, and that categorization must depend on probabilistic criteria
+ The concepts corresponding to concrete objects may be represented in both a “verbal” and a “visual” semantic memory system
+ problems affecting the ability of a patient to appreciate how an item is classified or what its necessary and typical features are.
+ brain damage may affect either the storage or the retrieval of word meanings
+ may be specific to certain types of inputs
+ may affect conscious and unconscious semantic processing differently
##### 1.4 Disorders of sentence comprehension 
+  Disturbances affect comprehension of simple and morphologically complex words affect comprehension at the sentence level and patients’ abilities to understand aspects of propositional meaning despite good single word comprehension. 
+  some patients can construct syntactic structures but not use them to determine propositional meaning 
+  end-of sentence comprehension performance and online observational method
##### 1.5 Comments on modern aphasiology 
#### 2 Language and the Brain
##### 2.1 The overall organization of the brain for language
+ correspondence between the presence or absence of cortical hypometabolism or hypoperfusion and the presence or absence of aphasic impairments in patients with strokes
+ lateralization: language processing relies upon one hemisphere more than another in most normal individuals
+  there is a considerable degree of plasticity for language even in adult brain.
##### 2.2 The organization of the perisylvian association cortex for language
+ localization of language processing components
##### 2.3 Lexical access and word meaning
+ evidence that speech perception recruits a neural processing stream involving both left posterior and anterior brain structures and that this neural stream consists of different processing stages that are located in specific areas
+ two-pathway model: ventral stream consists of an acoustic–phonetic conversion process located in STG bilaterally and a “lexico-semantic interface” in the posterior part of the left MTG
##### 2.4 Syntactic operations
+ One possibility is that the neural tissue that is responsible for the operations underlying sentence comprehension and syntactic processing is localized in several neural regions, and that the extent to which an area is involved differs in different individual
+ different types of linguistic operations may be supported by different types of brain organization
