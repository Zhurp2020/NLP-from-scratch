# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 1 Starting Points
### 1 Origins of Language
#### 1 Introduction
+ Religion: the Tower of Babel
+ 18 century, Rousseau, Condillac, Herder: applying one’s mind to the situation of languageless humans 
+ 19 century: increasingly feeble and speculative 
+ 1960s, Noam Chomsky:  discouraged interest in language evolution
+ 2002, Chomsky: a general “biolinguistic” exploration of biological bases for the  language capacity
#### 2 Evidence from Anthropology and Archeology
+  no uncontroversial evidence in the fossil record for specific stages in linguistic evolution.
+  a fully modern language  must have evolved before any geographically separated contemporary human group
   + otherwise: two fundamentally different kinds of language  
   + Australia, 40,000 - 60,000 or more years ago.
   + a firm terminus ante 
quem 
+ L-shaped vocal tract, important to the acoustic characteristics of speech sounds
   + Neanderthals, 35,000 years ago, rejected
   + bipedalism
      + reorientation of the head, shortening of the base of the skull, lowering of larynx 
      + Too early: 3.5-3 million years ago,'Lucy'
+ Brain first view: 
  + lower larynx was the consequence of more sophisticated language.
  + lowered larynx is not so unusual among nonhuman mammals
  + Brain Structure, Broca's area  
    + identifying in fossil is highly controversial
    + no area is associated with language alone
    + little to do with vocalization in monkeys 
+ handedness: the right hand is the dominant hand, controlled from the left side of the brain where the language areas are usually located.
  + no strong evidence
  + no details about the nature of that linguistic capacity. 
+ culture
  + a increase in the variety and quality of tools, 
  + Too late: Europe and Africa 40,000 years ago
  + Not true language, but symbols
  + cultural evidence thousands of years earlier,
#### 3 Genetic Evidence
+ mitochondrial DNA: inherited from the mother alone.
+ a woman lived roughly 200,000 years ago in Africa,   “African Eve.”
+ superior linguistic abilities enabled  descendants to outperform other humans and discouraged interbreeding
+ FOXP2 gene
  + found also in other species
  + ndirect, other relevant genes 
#### 4 Primatological Evidence  
##### 4.1 Vocal call systems
+ primate vocabularies lack referential calls 
  + Warning calls do contain referential information about the environment
+ only human language can be unreliable.
  + calls have a content independent of physical or emotional state.  
  + Vervets can  distinguish, in respect of another vervet, those topics on which it is a reliable witness from those on which it is not
##### 4.2 Cognitive abilities
+ primates know many more details about themselves, their conspecifics, and their environment than was previously suspected
  + a stage of cognitive readiness for language. 
+  only humans have access to propositional knowledge 
   +  chimpanzees can acquire and display awareness of abstract concepts and apply them
   + indulge in deception
+ Social relationships, vocal grooming
##### 4.3 Sign language experiments
+ language in humans may have originated in gesture, and only later been transferred to the vocal channel
  + a rubicon crossed by any nonhuman species with a clearly referential call vocabulary
+ evidence of rule-governed use of signs and lexigrams
#### 5 Neurobiological Evidence
+ relative priority of the vocal and gestural channels
  + Broca’s area's location reflects that human language has always been predominantly vocal
  + Damage to Broca’s area affects grammar and speech production more than it affects vocabulary.
+ Syntax evolution 
  + Wernicke’s aphasia:  needs something more specialized than general conceptual sophistication
  + neural structures for  syntactic organization of speech.
  + mirror neurons, imitative gesturing
    + if true, direct mimicry would have played an important role in early language acquisition
#### 6 Linguistic Evidence
##### 6.1 Protolanguage and “true” language 
+ pidgins, second languages in regular contact 
+ creoles, children acquire pidgins natively 
+ in environments where creoles originate, the universal human linguistic “bioprogram” reveals its characteristics most plainly
+ protolanguage utterances encoded whole messages rather than individual words
+ new neural connections  allowed speech to be hooked up to thematic structure
##### 6.2 Actual grammar versus conceivable grammars
+ inevitable characteristics
  + not biology but physics or mathematics.
  + there may be nothing that is both peculiar to language and peculiar to humans except recursion 
+ whether or not all aspects of grammar are well-engineered responses to natural selection  
    + grammatical distinction between sentences and noun phrases is bad engineering
#### 7 Conclusion 
+ few solid, uncontroversial conclusions.
