### 8 Functional Linguistics Communicative Functions and Language Structure
#### 1 Introduction 
+ functionalist: a view of language which takes its role in communication as central to its study and analysis
#### 2 Communicative Functions of Language 
+ the conveying of propositions from the mind of one interlocutor to the mind of one or more other interlocutors 
+ reference and predication are often taken to be the fundamental communicative functions of language. 
+ other verbal social interactions, speech acts  
e.g. ways of expressing assertions, interrogatives  and imperatives:  how the same communicative functions can be carried out in very different ways in different languages. 
+ pragmatics perspective: the meaning of and the conditions on the appropriate use of different speech acts.
+ discourse perspective: concerned with the construction of discourse and how grammatical and other devices are employed to serve this end  
e.g. gender pronoun and syntactic structure in referent tracking
+ forms are analyzed with respect to the communicative functions they serve, and functions are investigated with respect to the formal devices that are used to accomplish them. 
+ crosslinguistic comparison is a very significant feature of functional linguistics
#### 3 A Brief Look at the Development of Linguistic Theory in the Twentieth Century
+ structural linguistics,  Boas and Saussure lay out the foundations for linguistic science and thereby to define clearly and explicitly the object to be investigated in linguistic inquiry
+ Saussure argued that the proper subject for linguistic investigation is the system of signs, not the use of the system. 
+ co-occurrence (syntagmatic) and substitution (paradigmatic)
+ Chomsky: competence vs. performance, hence the communicative functions of language are irrelevant to the analysis of language structure
+ Czech linguist Mathesius in the 1920s as part of the Prague School: the elements expressing more established information (topic) precede the elements expressing new information (focus)
#### 4 Functional Approaches
+ Functional Grammar [FG], Systemic Functional Grammar [SFG], and Role and Reference Grammar
+ Conservative functionalism: augment standard formal analyses with functional principles, thereby creating an additional functional “component” or “module” in the grammar.
+ Moderate: view grammatical structure as strongly influenced by semantics and pragmatics and undertake to explore the interaction of structure and function in language
+ Extreme: rejects the validity of any notion of structure other than that of discourse structure and seeks a radical reduction of grammar to discourse
+ SFG: a strongly discourse-oriented view of language, but which nevertheless does not deny either the reality of structure in language nor the Saussurean foundations of modern linguistics
#### 5 Formal vs. Functional Approaches to Language
+ Formal approaches restrict themselves to theory-internal criteria in explanation
+ Formal linguists are strongly within a well-defined theoretical framework, but this is not the case with functionalists.
