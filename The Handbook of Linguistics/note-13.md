# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 3 Core Fields
### 13 Syntax
#### 1 The Domain of Syntax 
+ Syntax is the branch of linguistics that studies how the words of a language can be combined to make larger units, such as phrases, clauses, and sentences. 
+ primarily concerned with whether a sentence is “properly put together” rather than whether it is meaningful
+ morphology builds the words that are the starting point of syntax, discourse analysis involves the combination of sentences into even larger entities
#### 2 The Chomskyan Perspective 
##### 2.1  The use of formal mathematical tools
+ recursive function
##### 2.2 The goal of accuracy and explicitness
+ syntactic rules and patterns of a particular language should be stated explicitly and precisely, with nothing being taken for granted or left to the imagination
##### 2.3 The goal of simplicity and generality 
+ emphasis on simplicity, elegance, and generality
+ English rules
  + Merge: two syntactic objects can be joined together to make a larger syntactic object; 
  + Inclusiveness Condition: no properties can be added to a syntactic representation out of the blue; they must all be grounded in the lexical properties of the words that make up that representation. 
+ explicitness and accuracy tends to lead the linguist to put more and more detail and complexity into a linguistic theory, whereas the desire for simplicity and generality can lead one to downplay such detail
#### 3 Lessons of Syntactic Research
+ phrase construction rules
  + Extended Projection Principle: all normal sentences must have at least a subject NP and a verb
  + subject appears before the verb, and the object appears immediately after it.   
  + the object and the verb together form a tighter unit in English, with the subject attached to the sentence more loosely
  + Theta Criterion: an object must be present if and only if a particular verb calls for one semantically 
+ transformational rule
  + Move question words to before the first word of an S that contains them. 
  + Shift the auxiliary verb to the left of the subject NP in main clauses interpreted as questions. 
+ interpretive rule
  + Copy the referential index of an NP onto a pronoun as its referential index. 
##### 3.2 The centrality of constraints 
+ Complementizer Constraint: A sentence is ungrammatical if a complementizer comes immediately before a verb 
+ The Condition On Extraction Domains (CED): A phrase X can move out of a phrase Y only if Y is immediately contained in a Verb Phrase. 
+ C-command: An element X c-commands another element Y if the first phrase which properly contains X also properly contains Y. 
+ A pronoun X may not refer to the same thing as (have the same index as) a nonpronominal NP Y if X c-commands Y. 
+ constraints should not be built into the individual transformations themselves; rather they have a semi-independent existence
+ constraints are really more fundamental than the transformations themselves
#### 4 The Similarities and Differences among Human Languages
##### 4.1 The Syntax of Edo
+ somewhat different grammatical patterns can be explained as accommodations to the same syntactic constraints, illustrating the point that the constraints on transformations are the most abstract level of linguistic analysis, but also the most universal. 
##### 4.2 The syntax of Japanese
+ the head consistently comes at the end of the phrase in Japanese, whereas it comes at the beginning in English
+ it is possible to ask questions in Japanese that are very difficult to ask in English. 
##### 4.3 The syntax of Mohawk
+  no basic word order can be established
+  syntactic conditions seem to apply to complex word formation rather than to phrase-building， polysynthetic languages.
#### 5 A Glance Ahead
+ whether grammatical principles are predominantly general and wide-sweeping, or whether they can be very particular and specific
+ What is the role of formal and functional explanations in accounting for syntactic phenomena
+ whether languages that might look very different on the surface differ from one another in many small ways or in just a few big ways.
+ parts of speech: How many of these should be distinguished? Do languages always have the same ones
