## Part 3 Core Fields
### 12 The Lexicon
#### 1 Introduction
+ A list of the basic units constitutes the lexicon of the language
#### 2 Words 
+ no succinct definition applicable to all cases is possible, the best approach is to look for features characteristic of central examples of the class
#### 2.1 Lexical forms, lexical units, and lexemes
+ A dictionary provides a list of the lexemes of a language, each indexed by one of its word forms.
+ lexeme: a set of related meanings associated with a set of related word forms
+ sense: distinct meanings 
+ lexical unit:, the sound-meaning complex
#### 2.2 Individuating word forms: graphic and phonetic clues
+ word boundaries: spaces, stress patterns
#### 2.3 Grammatical properties of words 
#### 2.4 Semantic properties of words 
+ nonconstraint
+ conceptual coherence
  + Prototypical things are characterized by spatial continuity and persistence through time. 
  + Nonprototypical things must have something which confers unity on them.
+ internal completeness
  + the elements that constitute the meaning of a word must form a continuous dependency chain, with no gaps needing to be filled by elements from outside the word
#### 3 Lexical Semantics 
##### 3.1 Theoretical approaches
###### 3.1.1 The contextual / holistic approach
+ structural semantics: the meaning of a word as its position in a network of relationships
+ every word is linked, directly or indirectly, by means of specific links such with virtually every other word in the lexicon the meaning of a word is not fully comprehended until all these links are known
###### 3.1.2 The componential / localistic approach
+ the meaning of a word is a self-sufficient entity which in principle is finitely describable, the relations are a consequence of the word’s meaning. 
+ the meaning of a word ss a finite assemblage of elementary bits of meaning, each of which accounts for some aspect of the semantic behavior of the whole
###### 3.1.3 The conceptual approach
+ there is no theoretical work for an autonomous linguistic semantic level to do that cannot be performed at the conceptual level
+ the connection between words and the outside world is mediated through concepts, and therefore examining world–word relations is not the most profitable approach to word meaning
#### 4 How Many Meanings? Contextual Variability of Word Meaning
##### 4.1 Ambiguity
###### 4.1.1 The identity test
###### 4.1.2 The independent truth-conditions test
###### 4.1.3 The zeugma test
##### 4.2 Polysemy and homonymy
+ homonymous: an ambiguous word with unrelated readings 
+ polysemous: the readings are related, 
#### 5 Sense Relations
+ Paradigmatic: relations between the meanings of words which can occupy the same syntactic slot, and serve to unite the range of lexical meanings available at a particular point in a sentence into a more or less coherent structure. 
+ Syntagmatic sense relations hold between words in the same phrase or sentence
##### 5.1 Paradigmatic sense relations 
###### 5.1.1 Relations of inclusion and identity I: hyponymy: inclusion of one class in another,
+ For a lexical item $X$ to be a hyponym of another item $Y$, the truth of An $X$ is a $Y$ must follow logically from the meanings of $X$ and $Y$. 
###### 5.1.2 Relations of identity and inclusion II: meronymy: The part–whole relation
###### 5.1.3 Relations of identity and inclusion III: synonymy 
+ absolute synonymy: equinormal in all contexts
+ propositional synonyms: can be substituted in any declarative sentence salva veritate, that is, without changing its truth value
+ near synonyms: share a salient common core of meaning, but differ in relatively minor respects
###### 5.1.4 Relations of opposition and exclusion I: incompatibility and co-meronymy 
+ Incompatibility: mutual exclusion of classes: 
+ co-meronymy: : the sister parts of an individual whole do not have any material substance in common
###### 5.1.5 Relations of opposition and exclusion II: opposites
+ inherently binary: they belong together naturally and logically in pairs
+ Complementaries: negating either term logically implies the other
+ Antonyms: gradable adjectives which can be modified without oddness by intensifiers
  + The comparative forms of antonyms vary according to whether they presuppose the positive forms or not: committed/impartial
  + Polar antonyms: both members of a pair are impartial in the comparative
  + Overlapping antonyms: one member of a pair is committed in the comparative, the other is impartial
  + Equipollent antonyms: both members are committed in the comparative
  +  possibility of degree questions: what/how
+ Directional opposites
  + static directions
  + dynamic directional opposites
+ reverse and converse verbs
##### 5.2 Syntagmatic sense relations
+ some hold over relatively long 
stretches of text, between grammatically unrelated items, which typically do not involve propositional meaning or directional properties
+ some hold between closely related elements in the same grammatical construction and which do frequently involve propositional meaning and directional properties.
+ selector: imposes semantic conditions on possible partners, selectee satisfies the conditions
+ a grammatically dependent item must contribute semantic information not already present in the head
#### 6 Meaning Extensions and Change
##### 6.1 Established readings and nonce readings
+ nonce readings: comprehensible in context, but they are not an established part of the language, nor would we expect to find them in any dictionary
##### 6.2 Literal and nonliteral readings 
+ the default meaning；the one which comes first to mind when one is confronted by the word out of context
+ second, the reading from which the others can most plausibly be derived by standard semantic processes
##### 6.3 Metaphor
+ the projection of the conceptual structure appropriate to a familiar field onto a different and less familiar field
##### 6.4 Metonymy
+  based not on resemblances or analogies between items in different conceptual domains, but associations within a single conceptual domain
##### 6.5 Specialization and generalization
+ a change of inclusiveness, widening or narrowing down the meaning.
##### 6.6 Amelioration and pejoration 
+ a neutral or pejorative term becomes commendatory, and pejoration is when the reverse movement occurs
#### 7 Larger Groupings of Words
##### 7.1 Word fields 
+ taxonomies: structured by hyponymy and incompatibility 
+ meronomies, structured by meronymy and co-meronymy. 
##### 7.2 Word families
##### 7.3 Domain-specific vocabulary 
##### 7.4 Layers of vocabulary 
##### 7.5 The mental lexicon 
##### 7.6 Vocabularies 
#### 8 Conclusion
