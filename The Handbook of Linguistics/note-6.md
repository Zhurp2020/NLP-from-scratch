# The Handbook of Linguistics
## Part 2 Theoretical Bases
### 6The History of Linguistics  Approaches to Linguistics
#### 1 Introduction
#### 2 Grammatical Traditions
+ the Old-Babylonian tradition: first linguistic texts, Sumerian and Akkadian neurons
+ the Hindu tradition: Sanskrit
+ the Greek grammatical tradition: whether language originated in “nature”, with the first words supposedly imitating the things that they name, or in “convention”, that is, of human or divine invention
+ Roman linguistics
+ The Arabic grammatical tradition
+ The Hebrew linguistic tradition
+ Early Christian
#### 3 The Rise of Universal Grammar
+ 11-14 century: Semantic analysis dominate Europe
+ Speculative grammar: ways of signifying
+ scholars hold the basic forms of thought to be the basis of every grammar
#### 4 The Rise of the Comparative Method
+ after the Renaissance: large-scale word collections for language comparisons 
+ three principal criteria: basic vocabulary, sound correspondences, and grammatical agreements.
##### 4.1 The Scythian hypothesis and the notion of Indo-European
+ Scythae: a nation on a sea in the north in extreme antiquity, assumed father of Europe
##### 4.2 Sir William Jones 
+ Jones is usually credited with founding comparative linguistics and discovering the relationship among Indo-European languages
+ Grimm’s law: a series of changes in certain consonants from Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic, with exceptions
##### 4.3 The Neogrammarians 
+ sound change was regular and exceptionless, family tree model
+ opponent: wave theory: changes due to contact among languages and dialects, where changes emanate from a center as waves on a pond do when a stone is thrown into it'
#### 5 Philosophical-Psychological (-Typological-Evolutionary) Approaches
+ denying any value for the more humanistic,intellectual orientations, but a close analogy of linguistics with biology
+ concentrate on the origin of differences in languages and cultures, and this led to the idea of the particular “genius” of each language and through this to a “typology” of languages
+ inner structure
#### 6 The Rise of Structuralism
##### 6.1 Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) 
+ turn the tide of linguistic thought from the diachronic orientation to synchronic 
+ emphasized synchronic study of language structure and how linguistic elements are organized into the system of each language: signifier and signified
+ a system where everything is defined in terms of its relations to everything else
+ language, as socially shared and as a system, versus speech, the language of the individual
##### 6.2 The Prague School and its antecedents
##### 6.3 Franz Boas (1858–1942) 
+ considered the founder of American linguistics and American anthropology
+ linguistic relativity, avoid preconceptions and to describe each language and culture in its own terms
##### 6.4 Edward Sapir (1884–1939) 
+ Whorf (or Sapir–Whorf) hypothesi: a speaker’s perception of the world is organized or constrained by the linguistic categories his or her language offers 
##### 6.5 Leonard Bloomfield (1887–1949)
+ discovery procedures, the search for contrast and complementary distribution in the data recorded by linguists
+ no means of validating a description
#### 7 Noam Chomsky and Linguistic Theory since 1957
+ the goal of a grammar is to account for the native speaker’s “competence,” defined as what a native speaker knows, tacitly, of his or her language. 
+ an account of “competence” would require the formal means to produce or generate new sentences, hence a “generative grammar.” 
+ generative grammar is a formal system  which makes explicit the finite mechanisms available to the brain to produce infinite sentences in ways that have empirical consequences and can be tested as in the natural sciences
+ generalizing, of attempting to determine what languages hold in common and to establish a rich theory of human language
+ Universal Grammar: provide a rigorous and formal characterization of the notion “possible human language,” 
+ children have a genetic predisposition to acquire linguistic knowledge in a highly specific way.
#### 8 Typology 
+  classification of languages according to linguistic traits and the comparison of patterns (structures) across languages.
+  implicational universals
