### 17 Psycholinguistics
+ Psycholinguistics is the study of the interfaces between language structure and language use: between thought and production, production and comprehension, and comprehension and thought, as well as the many other cognitive systems that shape the use of language as it is flowing into and out of the mind in real time.
#### 1 Psycholinguistics as a Field of Study
+ Bottom-up describes processing that begins with the lowest level representations available, say, phonemes, and takes the output of that processing level as the input of the next level, say, syllables or morphemes.
+ Top-down describes processing that works in the opposite direction: higher levels of information are used to predict the content of upcoming lower level input and perhaps influence its ongoing integration.
#### 2 Language Production
+ a message is first generated and associated with lexicalized concepts. Next, the message passes on to a “formulator,” whose job it is to determine the grammatical properties of the lexicalized concepts and associate those concepts with lemmas from the lexicon, including appropriate morphological forms. Next, the phonological properties of the lemmas are filled in, and finally, articulation commences. 
+ syntactic, or structural, priming: people tend to repeat recently heard or spoken syntactic structures to encode new information. 
+ a degree of planning: more or less one clause
+ a growing body of literature on language production in more naturalistic tasks, such as actual conversations between two people: the linguistic expression of a message is affected significantly by elements of preceding discourse, the visual information in the immediate environment, and the perceived joint attention of both speaker and listener. 
#### 3 Language Comprehension
+ Ambiguity: a word or sentence can have two or more interpretations. temporary and global. Temporary ambiguities can be resolved by reading or listening to the rest of the sentence; global ambiguities cannot  
+ all meanings of a word are accessed immediately, and very quickly thereafter ( the meanings that are unrelated to the immediate context are inhibited, leaving only the appropriate meaning behind.
+ “mmediacy principle: as much as possible, we derive interpretations from incoming language input immediately as it comes in, i.e., sequentially, word by word
+ Late Closure and Minimal Attachment: prefer to fill all possible argument positions in the simplest possible way, rather than closing off the verb phrase or positing more complex continuations for incoming material.
+ serial, or two-stage models of syntactic parsing: the mind has a compartmentalized, or modular, architecture, within which certain processes operate over only very specific types of information. This idea leads to a view of sentence parsing that (a) takes as primary the syntactic structure-building process, and (b) uses in this process only syntactic information at the first stage of parsing 
+ single-stage view of sentence parsing is that all possible information sources – morphosyntactic, semantic, probabilistic, contextual, etc. – are computed in parallel. 
+ the usefulness of prediction in language processing is limited in one direction by countless possible continuations, even in constrained contexts, and in the other direction by the relatively small capacity of working memory and fallibility of retrieval processes
+ Storage costs accrue as elements are held longer in memory; Integration costs accrue as more elements need to be integrated at a given point.
+ retrieval-activation accounts or similarity-based interference accounts 
+ comprehension is susceptible to a number of influences, which stem from the overarching goal of language processing: to derive a coherent, plausible interpretation
+ theory of embodied cognition: language comprehension  is grounded in our kinesthetic experience with the world
#### 4 Developmental Psycholinguistics
+ whether the language processing of young children differs from that of adults, and, if so, how
+ high amplitude sucking paradigm, conditioned head turn procedure, intermodal preferential looking paradigm, looking-while-listening procedure
+ children are able to utilize probabilistic regularities in the input in their language learning 
+ Infants also use syntactically sophisticated probabilistic information to learn the meanings of new words
#### 5 Applied Psycholinguistics
+ second/foreign language processing.
+ Shallow Structure Hypothesis
+ even advanced non-native speakers produce certain perseverative errors when they speak or write in their second languages (L2), and furthermore, certain grammatical errors are often not noticed when listening or reading in an L2.
