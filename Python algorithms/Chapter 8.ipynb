What we need to do is relate the solution to this problem to some other problems, where at least one of the prefixes is smaller. Intuitively, we’d like to temporarily chop off some elements from the end of either sequence, solve the resulting problem by our inductive hypothesis, and stick the elements back on. If we stick with weak induction (reduction by one) along either sequence, we get three cases: Chop the last element from $a$, from $b$, or from both. If we remove an element from just one sequence, it’s excluded from the LCS. If we drop the last from both, however, what happens depends on whether the two elements are equal or not. If they are, we can use them to extend the LCS by one! (If not, they’re of no use to us.)\n",
