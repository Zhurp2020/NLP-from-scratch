    "Finding the connected components of a graph. A graph is connected if there is a path from each node to each of the others and if the connected components are the maximal subgraphs that are connected.   \n",
    "One way of finding a connected component would be to start \n",
    "at some place in the graph and gradually grow a larger connected subgraph until we can’t get any further. Let’s look at the following related problem. Show that you can order the nodes in a connected graph, $v_1, v_2, . .., v_n$, so that for any $i = 1.. .n$, the subgraph over $v_1, . .. , v_i$ is connected. If we can show this and we can figure out how to do the ordering, we can go through all the nodes in a connected component and know when they’re all used up.  \n",
    "we need to get from $i–1$ to $i$. We know that the subgraph over the $i–1$ first nodes is connected. Because there are paths between any pair of nodes, consider a node $u$ in the first $i–1$ nodes and a node $v$ in the remainder. On the path from $u$ to $v$, consider the last node that is in the component we’ve built so far, as well as the first node outside it. Let’s call them $x$ and $y$. Clearly there must be an edge between them, \n",

    "+ There is really only one situation where IDDFS would be preferable over BFS: when searching a huge tree (or some state space “shaped” like a tree). Because there are no cycles, we don’t need to remember which nodes we’ve visited, which means that IDDFS needs only store the path back to the starting node. BFS, on the other hand, must keep the entire fringe in memory (as its queue), and as long as there is some branching, this fringe will grow exponentially with the distance to the root. In other words, in these cases IDDFS can save a significant amount of memory, with little or no asymptotic slowdown."
